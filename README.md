This is a conveniently formatted HTML version of the Klingon text from the
[paq'batlh 2nd edition](https://punctumbooks.com/titles/paqbatlh-the-klingon-epic-2nd-edn/)
displayed in pIqaD characters, just for fun. Now you can always have the
paq'batlh at your fingertips, without all the pesky English translation!

Some liberties were taken, mostly to enable presentation in pure pIqaD:

* The "'" character in words like paq'batlh, paq'yav, etc…, is possibly not a
  qaghwI', but I've expressed it as a qaghwI' because we don't have any known
  pIqaD character for… whatever that thing is.
* The no' Hol text is presented as the presumed reconstructed "modern" Klingon,
  as far as vocabulary is concerned. I've preserved the archaic syntax, regular
  plural prefix, and "lost" prefixes, although I had to guess at the vowels for
  the latter.
* I changed the attribution for some of the lines from "Master of Scream" to
  "All", and vice versa, in a couple of places where there appeared to be an
  error in the paq'batlh text.
